Welcome to ETHelper - Dataset Generator and Local Tester for the Energy Transition Model (ETM)

## OVERVIEW

ETHelper is a front-end application which streamlines some of the key development processes for using the Energy Transition Model (ETM) (available at https://github.com/quintel). It allows users to create datasets inside etlocal and export migrations directly to etsource for use in the tool. It also automatically sets up a local run of the ETM (etengine + etmodel).

## DIRECTORIES

ethelper.py - application codebase.

config - configuration files for application.

icons - contains images used in the application.

output - contains the data.csv that gets generated by the application.

presets - contains .csv files to indicate which keys are relevant for specific database structures, as well as a categories folder with .csv files that specify the typologies of each key.

variables - contains list of keys and translations for each key in .csv format. 

development - contains material related to development process, including older iterations of the application codebase.

venv - contains files relating to the python virtual environment to run the application. 

## SETUP

To run the program, navigate to the ethelper directory using your CLI and create a python virtual environment with the following command:

python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment with:

source venv/bin/activate
(if on MacOS or Linux)

venv/Scripts/activate
(if on Windows)

Then install the required libraries within the virtual environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If streamlit needs upgrading, run:

pip install streamlit --upgrade

To run the application, use:

streamlit run ethelper.py

The application should run on the following default host and automatically open a tab on your internet browser:

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]:8501

Close the application with CNTRL+C

NOTE: Docker is required to run this application!

## FUNCTIONALITIES

NOTE: When inputting values for each key, do not change the preset group of keys, as this will delete your reset the preset-exclusive inputs!
