Welcome to ETHelper - Dataset Generator for the Energy Transition Model (ETM)

## DIRECTORIES

The application directory should look like this:

.
├── app.py
├── icons
│   ├── dsgen.png
│   └── logos.png
├── output
├── presets
│   ├── Default.csv
│   └── test.csv
├── variables
│   ├── keys.csv
│   └── translations.csv

app.py - application codebase.
config - 
icons - contains images used in the application.
imports - 
output - contains the data.csv that gets generated by the application.
presets - contains .csv files to indicate which keys are relevant for specific database structures, as well as a categories folder with .csv files that specify the typologies of each key.
variables - contains list of keys and translations for each key in .csv format. 
development - contains material related to development process, including older iterations of the application codebase.
venv - contains files relating to the python virtual environment to run the application. 

## SETUP

To run the program, navigate to the DSGen directory and create a python virtual environment with the following command:

python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment with:

source venv/bin/activate
(if on MacOS or Linux)

venv/Scripts/activate
(if on Windows)

Then install required libraries within the virtual environment:

pip install streamlit pandas
pip install watchdog
pip install matplotlib

If streamlit needs upgrading, run:

pip install streamlit --upgrade

Run the app with:

streamlit run app.py

The application should run on the following host:

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]:8501

Close the application with CNTRL+C

NOTE: When inputting values for each key, do not change the preset group of keys, as this will delete your reset the preset-exclusive inputs!
